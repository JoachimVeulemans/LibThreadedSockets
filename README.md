# LibThreadedSockets
Makes the use of tcp-sockets and protocols easier

**NOTE:** This library is no longer maintained and there are better ways to implement asynchronouos sockets (example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7105111/5495384). Also, the implementation is not that complicated that one should need a library for it. ðŸ˜„
